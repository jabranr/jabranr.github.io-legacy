After pretty much of a year long procrastination, finally I got the chance to setup my blog and folio! Since you already have shown some interest to spend some time here — therefore please let me offer you a warm welcome at my personal space.

For a long time, I had been thinking to have a personal space where I could share my thoughts in detail, present the ideas that strike me from time to time and of course discuss them with you all and showcase my involvements in various on going activities.

I hold an under-graduate degree in IT from WLCBMS and awaiting post-graduation results from Staffordshire University in Computer Science with major in Web development.

I hold deep interest in web technology, graphic designing, geo technologies and a lot of related stuff. I just love the way how web is taking over everything to provide most easiest approach for day to day services.

### Exploring this website

At this website, you will find my various kind of activities related to web, graphics, occasional photography and lot of other random stuff—hence I could not figure out a better title than “activities” for such a category.

In Blog section you will find my writings—in those I plan to cover various things that may come to my mind from time to time. Updating the folio and other activities from past will take some time so bear with me on that. You can either subscribe to the feeds or just stay in touch with me on social media where I’ll be posting any updates from this website.

I have tried to keep this website design as simple as possible and to best possible user experience. Although, I didn’t want to spend a lot of time in cross browser compatibility but you will still find this website suitable enough to explore on stone age versions of Internet Explorer. Not to mention the ease to exploring this website from your tablets and smart phones with its responsive design.

### Web mapping / cartography

I also contribute at [Google Map Maker](http://mapmaker.google.com/) platform to map Pakistan from time to time and I had been doing this passionately since July 2008. Since March 2011, I am serving as platform advocate (an honorary position) that enables me along with other advocates to organise web mapping events, help others to organise such events, lead and speak at these events to share the experience and benefits of digital maps—especially for developing countries. Since there is a lot to share in this regard, I shall write about this long journey at some different time in future.
