An interactive geo quiz game app to guess town/city name from given choices and a unmarked map. This is inspired from a geo-quiz by the [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/quizzes/Quiz-Can-you-identify-these-cities/).

The game is available to play at [http://jabran.me/guess-where](http://jabran.me/guess-where)
